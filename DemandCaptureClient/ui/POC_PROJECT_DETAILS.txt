requirements

	-	help the team with making their jobs easier

		-	there seems to be a portal that we can use to host the application
		-	need to find out where the code will be hosted and where the application will be 			hosted
		-	there seems to be a need for POC’s to communicate or at least a discussion around 			that, also need to go through spreadsheet and see whats mandatory and whats 			optional		
		-	the systems seems to have these major epics; capture, admin( add types, people, 			demands etc), analysis(reports and graphs)
		-	need to think around pre-pupulation of customer details etc
		-	ability to import current data, from excel
		-	very slow since spread sheet is a shared resource
		-	everyone has a spread sheet on a shared folder that they fill out and consolidate on a 			master spread sheet
		-	there’s a vanguard charting tool that only accepts excel or access database

		-	there also a need to not only look at demands, but also look at improvements i.e 			some data analysis, need to question what this analysis entails

	-	work hours; generally from 8 to 6 there’s 2 shifts, from 8 then from 9:30 but happy if we put 		in our 8 hours a day

extant of listening;

		customers demand: 
		what was the customer trying to solve for now and future
		was it value or failure
		what prevented us from doing it perfectly
		what mattered to the customer in how we solved it
		how was the consultant understanding and delivery 


requirements for the forms;

access to repository
access to hosting environment, 
details of hosting environment,

	- they currently don’t have capacity (both interms of server space and resources, the dev is in 	  cape town and unless they do everything, they aren’t too keen) and we’ve asked them to hold 	  on.
	- also not keen on working on their tech stack as it might not be able to solve our issues as they 	  come up
	- developer is in cape town

=================================================
to get import working 

>  sudo easy_install pip
> sudo pip install rethinkdb

from windows, export the spread sheet as csv file 
in mac open it and save it as utf-8 encoding
then run;
> rethinkdb import -f data3.csv --format csv --table Demands.demand --force

P.S when importing, you have to change fields "Date" to "date" in the header of the import, else socket io complains
