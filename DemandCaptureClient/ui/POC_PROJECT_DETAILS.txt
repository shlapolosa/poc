those in the work, change an improve
check plan do
system holistically (process, policies and procedures)
work out a process (using imperial data) of what matters, perfect it then automate it.

demand is broken into Type and frequency
value demand and demand failure

flow is determined by whether we need physical contact or not, no contact no flow

the point is that as a business, instead of saying we need to sell this product to our customers to make money, you say that our customers are saying they need this, and this will then make you the money!!!!!

don’t make  comparisons, similar but the DSL is important

how can we change
why are we here
challenge individually/how much change

help business make technical decisions and help interpret the data
business makes sure we are solving the right problem, we look at what is the best solution


do we know enough about our processes to be effective
skill sets for understanding the business problem

understanding - vanguard method with tw feeding into the decisions regarding whats big IT and small it e.g.. implementing 

we are there to provide to the customer what is possible cause once they know it will help them think better of the problems.

===========================================================================================================================================================================


Ford - mass production is the production of more than you can sell - this was bad cause it lowers quality
Toyota - just in time

what is the role of management in the vanguard system?

the nominal value is what matters, making things more and more alike

standardisation is bad, one size does not fit all!

Bohica - Bend over here it comes again

its important to understand the what and why

purpose -> measure ->  method

Mr Roberson blocked his card yesterday then wanted to check his transections as well as replace blocked card, he made a transaction on a fraudulent website hence blocked the card, he wanted to stop the transaction he had made. she could not help cause transaction was already approved.

Value - demanded a statement and a reversal

Bevirly Has been asking over and over for her statements to be emailed to her but she's not getting them, she asked her to hold then sent them to her manually, her statements were blocked but it was never picked up, she unblocked them, sent them.
