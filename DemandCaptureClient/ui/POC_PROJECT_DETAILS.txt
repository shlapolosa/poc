requirements

	-	help the team with making their jobs easier

		-	already have a template for a form, (but it might need to be a dynamic form as there 			are multiple POC’s each with their own requirements)
		-	there seems to be a portal that we can use to host the application
		-	need to find out where the code will be hosted and where the application will be 			hosted
		-	there seems to be a need for POC’s to communicate or at least a discussion around 			that, also need to go through spreadsheet and see whats mandatory and whats 			optional		
		-	the systems seems to have these major epics; capture, admin( add types, people, 			demands etc), analysis(reports and graphs)
		-	need to think around pre-pupulation of customer details etc
		-	ability to import current data, from excel
		-	very slow since spread sheet is a shared resource
		-	everyone has a spread sheet on a shared folder that they fill out and consolidate on a 			master spread sheet
		-	there’s a vanguard charting tool that only accepts excel or access database

		-	there also a need to not only look at demands, but also look at improvements i.e 			some data analysis, need to question what this analysis entails
		-	what is a card note?

		-	capability chart: collate the data sheet
		- 	avaya CMS; telephony team some sort of alert ()
			-	can create beep on the headphones, but only when consultant is available
			-	find out how to access remote servers
			- 	Martha Mafisa (083)6127794/0102494005/0112993167			-	they can setup a button on the fone that lets you onow there are calls on hold
			- 	i can look at api

			extension, loginId , name , surname

		-	a couple of technologies might be useful, firstly look at nosql db since we don’t want 
			to be tied by schema
		-	look at C3.js with angular for rendering our graphs 
		-	look at eon for redering realtime data with graphs; 
			http://www.pubnub.com/blog/building-realtime-live-updating-animated-graphs-c3-js/
		-	rethinkdb gives ability to stream data and is also a nosqldb
		-	need some sort of scheduling where we can have visibility of who is doing what.
		-	need a chart to show changes that then relate to trend

0836097285
	-	come up with suggestions customer demands, to make their life easier

		- automate beneficiary capture

	-	keep in mind interaction between Vangaurd and TW

admin

	-	work hours; generally from 8 to 6 there’s 2 shifts, from 8 then from 9:30 but happy if we put 		in our 8 hours a day
	-	team meetings at 3
	-	there’s a concept of a chairman who coordinates shifts and calls as in who is available to 		to take calls


extant of listening;

		customers demand: 
		what was the customer trying to solve for now and future
		was it value or failure
		what prevented us from doing it perfectly
		what mattered to the customer in how we solved it
		how was the consultant understanding and delivery 


requirements for the forms;

access to repository
access to hosting environment, 
details of hosting environment,


Business Perfomance solutions
	- John Gaydon
	- they currently don’t have capacity (both interms of server space and resources, the dev is in 	  cape town and unless they do everything, they aren’t too keen) and we’ve asked them to hold 	  on.
	- also not keen on working on their tech stack as it might not be able to solve our issues as they 	  come up
	- developer is in cape town

ability to create the form, apply all the automatic conditions, then give the guys opportunity to apply all the manual conditions some how

=================================================
to get import working 

>  sudo easy_install pip
> sudo pip install rethinkdb

from windows, export the spread sheet as csv file 
in mac open it and save it as utf-8 encoding
then run;
> rethinkdb import -f data3.csv --format csv --table Demands.demand --force

P.S when importing, you have to change fields "Date" to "date" in the header of the import, else socket io complains

to export

rethinkdb export -c localhost:28015 -e Demands.Demand --format csv --fields date,Name,Customer_Details,test


capchart vs winchart look at vanguarud website

===========================================node server setup====================================

create deployment user
sudo useradd --create-home -s /bin/bash deploy
sudo adduser deploy sudo
sudo passwd deploy
log out, then ssh again as deploy ssh -p 3022 deploy@127.0.0.1

mkdir .ssh
exit
scp -P 3022 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub deploy@127.0.0.1:~/.ssh/authorized_keys
now user doesnt need password to log in


install latest version of node by running on ubuntu 14.04
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.25.4/install.sh | bash
nvm ls-remote
nvm install v0.12.1

install forever

sudo npm install bower


source /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt $DISTRIB_CODENAME main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/rethinkdb.list
wget -qO- http://download.rethinkdb.com/apt/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install rethinkdb
mkdir Rethikdb

//netword nat then go to port forwarding and do
Host port 3022, guest port 22, name ssh, other left blank.
 (on vm) sudo apt-get install openssh-server
ssh -p 3022 osboxes@127.0.0.1



install flight plan for auto deployment inside the project not on vm

npm install -g flightplan
npm install --save-dev flightplan (in project folder)
Make sure ssh-agent is running (typically /usr/bin/ssh-agent).
Then add your private key:
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa


create poc.conf and put in on vm /etc/init/poc.conf
start poc
stop poc

give deploy user ability to run command as root on vm

echo "deploy ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:/sbin/restart poc" >> /etc/sudoers
visudo

remove last two lines of flight plan file
and add remote.exec('sudo restart poc')

changed osboxes password to root
The solution is same for all Linux distributions
1. Start virtual machine and suddenly you will see the GRUB (Tip: if you don’t see GRUB then press SHIFT key when virtual machine starts, if you miss then you need to try again).
2. Select recovery entry from GRUB.
3. Now you will see recovery menu, select root (Drop to root shell prompt) option.
4. Type this command mount -rw -o remount / and press enter.
5. Now type passwd osboxes and press enter.
6. Enter new password twice and enter exit to reboot.

===========Project Genesis================

ccc vs prestige and private when it comes to skills when setting up the avaya displays

how do we run the application in prod?

looking at digitalocean/horoku as a hosting environment
have security group or virtual network functionality from your hosting provider i.e (Amazon Web Services Virtual Private Cloud, security groups)

looking at nginx as a static web server and reverse proxy

traffic on the networks should be limited to 100kb per message and a response time of 10s max.
